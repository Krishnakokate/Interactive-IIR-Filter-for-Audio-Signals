# Interactive IIR Audio Filter GUI

This MATLAB application provides an interactive GUI for implementing IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters on audio signals. It allows users to choose different filter types, customize filter parameters such as order and cutoff frequency, and visualize the effects on the original audio signal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2020a or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishnakokate/Interactive-IIR-Filter-for-Audio-Signals.git

Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

Run the iir_filter.m script to launch the GUI.

### Features
- Choose different IIR filter types: Low-pass, High-pass, Band-pass, and Band-stop.
- Customize filter parameters such as order and cutoff frequency.
- Visualize the original and filtered audio signals in real-time.
- Listen to the audio output after applying the selected filter.

### Usage
- Launch the application by running iir_filter.m in MATLAB.
- Select the desired filter type from the drop-down menu.
- Adjust the filter parameters (order, cutoff frequency) using the respective input fields.
- Click the "Apply Filter" button to see the real-time effect on the original audio signal.
- Listen to the filtered audio output using the "Play Filtered Audio" button.
